# 👋 Hi, I'm Aida Mohammadshahi

I'm a Machine Learning Developer with a passion for building robust, production-ready AI systems. My focus is on **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **efficient deep learning**, and **trustworthy AI**. I combine strong research foundations with hands-on experience in deploying models and pipelines across academic and industrial settings.

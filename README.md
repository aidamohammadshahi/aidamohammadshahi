Hi,

I am a full-time computer engineering masters student at the University of Calgary. 
I do my research on the robustness and bias of Sparse Neural Networks.
I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Electrical Engineering from Iran University of Science and Technology and worked on computer vision and slef-driving cars.
My research interests include Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision.

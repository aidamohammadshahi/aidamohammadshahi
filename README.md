Hi,

I am a full-time computer engineering master's student at the University of Calgary. I do my research on the robustness and bias of Sparse Neural Networks. I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Electrical Engineering from the Iran University of Science and Technology and worked on computer vision and self-driving cars. My research interests include Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision.

# Hi, I'm Aida Mohammadshahi

I’m a machine learning developer and researcher passionate about building intelligent systems that actually work in the real world. My focus areas include **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **Computer Vision**, and **efficient model training and deployment** with a strong eye on **fairness** and **scalability**. I combine strong research foundations with hands-on experience in deploying models and pipelines across academic and industrial settings.


## What I Do

**LLMs & NLP Systems**  
I fine-tune Large Language Models (like LLaMA) and build intelligent systems that actually understand context. From retrieval-augmented generation to semantic search, I help machines read between the lines—sometimes better than people do.

**Agentic AI & Multi-Agent Systems**  
I design intelligent agents that can plan, collaborate, and execute complex tasks—autonomously. Using frameworks like LangGraph and LangChain, I’ve built multi-agent LLM systems that coordinate workflows and dynamically retrieve and reason over knowledge.

**Bias & Fairness in AI**  
I analyze how efficient training methods (like pruning or distillation) affect model behavior and fairness. My work bridges the gap between performance and ethics—because faster models shouldn't mean unfair ones.

**Efficient Deep Learning**  
SparseGPT? Wanda? LoRA? Been there, benchmarked that. I use these tools to reduce compute while keeping models sharp and responsible.

**Computer Vision**  
From newborn MRI segmentation to real-time traffic surveillance, I apply deep learning where precision matters. I've worked with U-Nets, YOLOv5, and domain adaptation techniques to make CV models useful in real-world, high-stakes applications.

**Cloud & MLOps**  
Azure, AWS, Docker, CI/CD—you name it. I make sure ML models don’t just train well but run well, scale well, and behave themselves in production environments.
